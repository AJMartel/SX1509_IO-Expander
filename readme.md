# SX1509 16-I/O Expander

The SX1509 is an I<sup>2</sup>C I/O expander, with many features under the hood:

* 16 channels of bi-directional I/O - Pull-up/down resistors, push/pull or open-drain outputs, programmable polarity.
* 5.5V tolerant I/O's (1.2-3.6V operating voltage)
* LED Driver: PWM and blink control on all I/O's, breathe capability on a select few.
* Level shifting I/O's: Independent I/O rails (VCC1, VCC2) allow for up/down level shifting.
* Keypad scanning engine: Supports up to 64 keys (in an 8x8 matrix configuration).

The SparkFun breakout and Arduino library exist to help you get the most out of this awesome little chip and the features it provides.

# What's here?
*Arduino*: This directory contains the Arduino library. This directory's structure follows that of your standard Arduino sketchbook installation. A *libraries* folder within contains the **SX1509 library**.

*hardware*: This directory contains the Eagle design files - the breakout PCB and schematic design. These files were created with version 6.2.0 of Eagle Cad - a lite version is available, for free, at [www.cadsoftusa.com](http://www.cadsoftusa.com).
