The SX1509 16 Output I/O Expander Breakout Board makes it easy to prototype using the SX1509 so you can add more I/O onto your Arduino or I/O limited controller. It can leverage your I2C interface for 16 extra channels of GPIO and contains a fully programmable LED driver and a keypad scanning engine which enables continuous keypad monitoring of up to 64 keys. Since the I/O banks can operate between 1.2V and 3.6V (5.5V tolerant) independent of both the core and each other, this device can also work as a level-shifter.

Features include:

* 16 channels of bi-directional I/O - Pull-up/down resistors, push/pull or open-drain outputs, programmable polarity.
* 5.5V tolerant I/O's (1.2-3.6V operating voltage)
* LED Driver: PWM and blink control on all I/O's, breathe capability on a select few.
* Level shifting I/O's: Independent I/O rails (VCC1, VCC2) allow for up/down level shifting.
* Keypad scanning engine: Supports up to 64 keys (in an 8x8 matrix configuration).
